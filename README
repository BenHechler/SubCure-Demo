SubCure: Stress-Testing Causal Claims via Data Repair
SubCure is an interactive system for stress-testing causal claims derived from observational data. Rather than validating a causal estimate directly, SubCure probes its robustness by identifying small, targeted data modifications that can significantly alter the estimated Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
The system exposes how sensitive a causal conclusion is to individual records or structured subpopulations, helping users understand which data supports the claim and why.

Motivation
Causal analyses based on observational data are widely used in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. These analyses typically rely on assumptions about confounding, data quality, and robustness.
In practice:
•	A small subset of records may disproportionately drive causal estimates.
•	Certain subpopulations may encode unintended bias.
•	Standard robustness checks often fail to explain which data points matter and how they affect the result.
SubCure is designed to make these dependencies explicit and inspectable.

System Overview
Given a dataset and a causal query (treatment, outcome, confounders), SubCure:
1	Computes a baseline ATE, representing the current causal claim.
2	Allows the user to specify a target ATE and tolerance.
3	Applies a data repair strategy that removes as little data as possible to shift the ATE toward the target.
4	Analyzes and reports structural patterns among the removed data.
The implementation is estimator-agnostic. The current prototype uses a linear regression estimator for ATE computation, but alternative estimators can be integrated without changing the repair logic.

Repair Strategies
SubCure supports two complementary repair modes:
Tuple-Level Repair
Removes individual records whose removal most efficiently shifts the ATE.
•	Fine-grained
•	Minimal data loss
•	Useful for detecting influential outliers
Pattern-Level Repair
Removes entire subpopulations defined by shared attribute values (e.g., age group, gender).
•	Coarser but more interpretable
•	Highlights structural dependencies
•	Useful for identifying subgroup sensitivity and bias

Removed-Tuple Analysis
After a repair is applied, SubCure analyzes the removed data to explain why the causal estimate changed.
This includes:
•	Over-represented categorical values
•	Statistical shifts in numeric features
•	Common attribute patterns among removed records
These summaries help translate causal fragility into domain-relevant insights.

How to Use the System
SubCure is provided as an interactive Streamlit application.
Step 1: Load a Dataset
•	Select a built-in dataset (e.g., ACS, German Credit, Twins), or
•	Upload a custom CSV file.
Step 2: Define the Causal Query
Select:
•	Treatment variable
•	Outcome variable
•	Confounders (variables affecting both treatment and outcome)
SubCure immediately computes and displays the baseline ATE.
Step 3: Specify a Target ATE
•	Set a desired ATE value and tolerance range.
•	This defines an alternative causal outcome used to test robustness.
Step 4: Choose a Repair Strategy
•	Select tuple-level or pattern-level repair.
•	Optionally limit the maximum number of records to remove.
Step 5: Run the Repair
SubCure:
•	Applies the repair strategy,
•	Shifts the ATE toward the target,
•	Reports the new ATE and the number of removed records.
Step 6: Interpret the Results
The interface displays:
•	Original vs. repaired ATE
•	Summary statistics of removed records
•	Common attribute patterns among removed tuples
These outputs help explain which parts of the data were most influential.
